# 🍰 Vanilla HTML + JS Team Generator 🍰

### Why? 🤷🏻‍♀️

Why not! I have been building in React ONLY for almost a year now and I decided it was time for me to brush up on PRACTICAL BASICS.

Working as a TA, I go over this concepts pretty often, but I never find the time to actually practice some coding 🤓

### What? 🎃

I tried to keep this as simple as possible. 

And I mean SIMPLE. I built this using for of loops, DOM manip and vanilla CSS instead of React, ES6+ syntax and SASS like I usually do.

There are a couple things I would like to polish (like the `assing()` function), but overall I'm happy I still got it! :sparkles:
